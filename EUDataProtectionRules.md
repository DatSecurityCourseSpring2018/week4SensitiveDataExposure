#  Reform of EU data protection rules

As I tried to find some good material on the new Data protection law in English, I ultimately ended up on the home pages of the EU. The structure their info in a little scattered manner. This document puts together a few of the key definitions which was actually rather readable.

## What does the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) govern?
IT regulates the processing by an individual, a company or an organisation of personal data relating to individuals in the EU.

It doesn’t apply to the processing of personal data of deceased persons or of legal entities.

The rules don’t apply to data processed by an individual for purely personal reasons or for activities carried out in one's home, provided there is no connection to a professional or commercial activity. When an individual uses personal data outside the personal sphere, for socio-cultural or financial activities, for example, then the data protection law has to be respected.

### Examples
When the regulation applies

A company with an establishment in the EU provides travel services to customers based in the Baltic countries and in that context processes personal data of natural persons.

When the regulation doesn’t apply

An individual uses their own private address book to invite friends via email to a party that they are organising (household exception).

## What is personal data?
Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data.

Personal data that has been de-identified, encrypted or pseudonymised but can be used to re-identify a person remains personal data and falls within the scope of the law.

Personal data that has been rendered anonymous in such a way that the individual is not or no longer identifiable is no longer considered personal data. For data to be truly anonymised, the anonymisation must be irreversible.

The law protects personal data regardless of the technology used for processing that data – it’s technology neutral and applies to both automated and manual processing, provided the data is organised in accordance with pre-defined criteria (for example alphabetical order). It also doesn’t matter how the data is stored – in an IT system, through video surveillance, or on paper; in all cases, personal data is subject to the protection requirements set out in the GDPR.

### Examples of personal data
* a name and surname;
* a home address;
* an email address such as name.surname@company.com;
* an identification card number;
* location data (for example the location data function on a mobile phone)*;
* an Internet Protocol (IP) address;
* a cookie ID*;
* the advertising identifier of your phone;
* data held by a hospital or doctor, which could be a symbol that uniquely identifies a person.

### Examples of data not considered personal data
* a company registration number;
* an email address such as info@company.com;
* anonymised data.

## What constitutes data processing?
Processing covers a wide range of operations performed on personal data, including by manual or automated means. It includes the collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction of personal data.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means as well as to non-automated processing, if it is part of a structured filing system.

###Examples of processing
* staff management and payroll administration;
* access to/consultation of a contacts database containing personal data;
* sending promotional emails*;
* shredding documents containing personal data;
* posting/putting a photo of a person on a website;
* storing IP addresses or MAC addresses;   
* video recording (CCTV).

## Other aspects
The original list has more aspects which are a little out of our focus right now.

## What is a data controller or a data processor?
Further down in the text there two roles are mentioned which is good to know about as IT experts - Controller and processor. The words are used to cover humans or companies - not machines! Source: <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/obligations/controller-processor/what-data-controller-or-data-processor_en>

The data controller determines the purposes for which and the means by which personal data is processed. So, if your company/organisation decides ‘why’ and ‘how’ the personal data should be processed it is the data controller. Employees processing personal data within your organisation do so to fulfil your tasks as data controller.

Your company/organisation is a joint controller when together with one or more organisations it jointly determines ‘why’ and ‘how’ personal data should be processed. Joint controllers must enter into an arrangement setting out their respective responsibilities for complying with the GDPR rules. The main aspects of the arrangement must be communicated to the individuals whose data is being processed.

The data processor processes personal data only on behalf of the controller. The data processor is usually a third party external to the company. However, in the case of groups of undertakings, one undertaking may act as processor for another undertaking.

The duties of the processor towards the controller must be specified in a contract or another legal act. For example, the contract must indicate what happens to the personal data once the contract is terminated. A typical activity of processors is offering IT solutions, including cloud storage. The data processor may only sub-contract a part of its task to another processor or appoint a joint processor when it has received prior written authorisation from the data controller.

There are situations where an entity can be a data controller, or a data processor, or both.

### Examples
#### Controller and processor

A brewery has many employees. It signs a contract with a payroll company to pay the wages. The brewery tells the payroll company when the wages should be paid, when an employee leaves or has a pay rise, and provides all other details for the salary slip and payment. The payroll company provides the IT system and stores the employees’ data. The brewery is the data controller and the payroll company is the data processor.

#### Joint controllers

Your company/organisation offers babysitting services via an online platform. At the same time your company/organisation has a contract with another company allowing you to offer value-added services. Those services include the possibility for parents not only to choose the babysitter but also to rent games and DVDs that the babysitter can bring. Both companies are involved in the technical set-up of the website. In that case, the two companies have decided to use the platform for both purposes (babysitting services and DVD/games rental) and will very often share clients’ names. Therefore, the two companies are joint controllers because not only do they agree to offer the possibility of ‘combined services’ but they also design and use a common platform.
